# timehub companion
Timehub companion is the mobile app designed to create a seamless experience for your [timehub](https://github.com/Jouhney/timehub). It is designed around timehub and uses the [supabase](https://supabase.io) backend. The companion app is open-source, just like timehub is, but for the communication between the app and timehub there needs to be a backend, hosted in the cloud. That means that the companion app doesn't use a lot of on-device code **but** it is still as privacy respecting as timehub and its features.

# Features
| Feature | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| to-do   | Integration with the to-do widget for timehub| under development|
| timehub settings | Change the settings for your timehub device | planned |
| timehub dashboard | Show internet usage, CPU temperature and other core vitals of your timehub | planned |

## Roadmap
The companion app is currently in beta. Features get added, improved and sometimes even removed without any communication to the community. That should change in the following months, as more features get added and become more stable.

# Stand-alone usage
Timehub companion is usable even without a timehub instance. It is recommended to use it in combination with timehub, as it is built around it.

# Development
The companion app is built using Dart and Flutter, just like timehub. It is meant to be a phone app and is not designed for desktop usage.
